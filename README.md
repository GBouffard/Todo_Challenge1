1st attempt at the Todo challenge in JS / Jquery / Angula / Node.

todo.js

- Add task method
initialize state false
- done task
state is true
- delete task method
if not done, not possible.

and that's my list
task are stored in an hash as strings, value are true or false.

All --> full array.
Active --> show task equal false
Complete --> show task equal true
Clear all --> delets array.

Each of these return a sum of these tasks.
